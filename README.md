## Shortcuts/Compromises Made
- The app is not fully functional. It is only a prototype.
- The app does not have a backend. It is only a frontend prototype.
- The app is using a google loging for authentication. This is not the best way to authenticate users. because I had a problem with creating application in facebook developer page
   see the issue on bug report  [https://developers.facebook.com/support/bugs/261648152949557].
